Some months ago I bought a serious drilling press. I was investigating for months looking for a good quality drill press after The Cincinnati was sold. Finally, I favoured a Wörner B13. Although unusual, it's a nice and high quality machine.  
  
The machine came from Lithuania but they it is made in Germany.  The machine  condition is good but suffers from aestetical issues and some signs of age. Additionally, someone modified the driving system adding and intermediate pulley to lower the rotation speeds range.  
  
Below there are some pictures of the machine as it was when arrived.

The machine can be seen running in a short video:
