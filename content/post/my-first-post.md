# Making drill bushes for the Reglus jig #


Because of reasons, I needed to drill some shafts with some weird diameters. I didn't have the required bushes. Then, I decided to make some of them. This post shows how I did.


These are the most salient characteristics of this project:


  * Material. I choosed O2 steel. Easy to mechanize and harden. Hard enough after thermical treatment.


  * Dimensioning. I got the main dimensioning from other bushes in the set and adapted them to the hole dimension.


  * Bushes where hard-turned to size after being hardened to cope with dimension changes induced by heat treatment..
