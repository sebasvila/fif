The factors that make a machine to "work smoothly" are many: rigidity,
weight, ergonomy, power, sensitivity,... Between them, the working
precision is of utmost importance.  Testing procedures as those
proposed by Schlesinger in its famous book try to determine the
overall state of a metalworking machine by measuring some critical
points. Testing tables abridged these measures for a kind of machine.


In this post I show the result of carrying a sequence of tests to the
rebuild Wörner drilling press. I took and Aciera 10 driiling machine
test table as a reference. Both machines are of similar size and
Aciera quality is second to none.


The results obtained are shown [in this doc](/pdfs/taula-control-b13.pdf).


You can see that runout of the spindle is perfectly under the
limit. However, the orthogonality of the quill respect the table is
not satisfied. Although not critical, I will stick a new todo on the
window to further investigate this issue.


In the case you are interested to test your drilling machine with the
same card, you can download this empty version (translated to catalan)
that I prepared: [drilling machine testing
card](/pdfs/aciera13-control.pdf).


Below, you will find a short video of the testing work of the MK2
socket runout. Note that the indicator is graduated in 2 µm steps.
