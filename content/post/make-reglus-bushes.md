# Make some drill bushings for the Reglus jig

Because of reasons, I needed to cross drill some shafts with some
weird diameters. I own an old imperial Reglus drilling jig but I
didn't have the required bushings. I decided to make some of them. This
post shows how drilling bushings where made.

These are the most salient characteristics of this project:

* Material. I choosed O2 steel. Easy to mechanize and harden. Hard
  enough after thermical treatment.

* Dimensioning. I got the main dimensioning from other bushingss in
  the set and adapted them to the hole dimension. Here you can get a
  [dimensioned drawing](/pfds/dolla-reglus.pdf) of a Reglus bushing.

* Bushings where hard-turned to size after being hardened to cope with
  dimension changes induced by heat treatment.

After cutting the steel bar to required length, the part is rougly
turned and the top hole drilled.

Then, the drill hole is pointed and drilled. The bushing is gripped
using a fine collet. This guarantees concentricity up to 0.01mm. The
drilling, however, should be done with care to remain concentric.

After that, bushings where chamfered as required and stamp marked with
the size. Next operation was hardening. The quenching medium was oil
and the home owen were used to tempering them at 200ÂºC. This was the
result:

Finally, the external diameter of the bushing is hard-turned to
size. Doing this after hardening let's to manage the thermally induced
diameter changes and to provide an excellent surface finish to the
gripping face. Below, you can see some pictures of the hard-turning
process.

New bushings mounted on the drilling gig look as follows.
