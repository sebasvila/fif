This is how the drilling machine return spring looks when I opened the
cover:

A previous owner did a not very successful repair and modified the
internal attachment of the spring. As a result, spring was badly
deformed and have a unusual feeling during the descent. I extracted it
by pulling it out of the cup and then giving it a quarter turn to free
the external end from its attachment (it has a rectangular shape as
you will see next). These are the pictures of the empty cup, the
spring, and the modified shaft. Originally the internal attachment was
means of a pin in the shaft while now it uses a slitted shaft.

The decision was to make a new spring. It was comisioned to [Metal
Springs Valles](https://www.springsvalles.com/ca/) according to [this
specifications](/pdfs/molla-retorn.pdf). They made it in a week. This
is a picture of new and old springs:

Finally, the new spring was mounted in the receiving cup:
