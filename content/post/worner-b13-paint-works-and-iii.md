### Joan's advices


Final steps on paint works. I last post I wrote about the problems
with the table lack: final layers suffered of cracking. After a talk
with a Joan, who has a large experience as professional car painter
and always has time to help a friend, he diagnosed the problem: layers
incompatibility. He gave me a kinda of principles to follow when
painting machines. I want to share then here:


1.  Scrap all old lacks until you achieve clean steel. Do not try to
    take advantage of the old layers of paint nor putty.
2.  Apply polyester putty over the bare steel. Sand it and correct
    until the desired profiles are achieved.
3.  Apply a layer of high solids filler. Smooth lightly with high
    number water sand paper to obtain a regular and smooth finish.
4.  Spray the final coats of coloured paint.
5.  Use always the same reference for all the products used. Do not
    mix products from distinct providers.
6.  Never put 2K layers over 1K layers.
7.  Spraying is more aggressive with base layers that hand painting
    (because of solvents used).


Following, you will find some pictures of the drilling press table
second painting round:

This time things have gone better and the drill press is finished to
be assembled!

### Hammer paint


Some of the machine parts were not mechanized and in the original
state they were painted using silver tone hammered effect lack. I
followed the same pattern:

### Opal green colour stripe


A distinctive detail of this series of machines was an opal green
colour stripe that turns around the pulleys cover. I reproduced it too
for the sake of completeness. It corresponds to RAL 6026.
