Some days ago appeared in ebay a great Leinen MLZ 4 SB lathe to
sell. The pictures in ebay also showed a manual for the lathe. This
model is close to the type of [my lathe](/tags/leinen-lz4sb/). Thus, I
decided to talk with the seller and to ask him if it is possible to
send me a copy of the manual. People
at [der-gebrauchtwarenhandel](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/e11051.m44.l1181/7?euid=d81426a730c84755b7a18617b5b0aa75&loc=http%3A%2F%2Fmyworld.ebay.es%2Fder-gebrauchtwarenhandel),
the Ebay seller, where really kind and they sent me a scan of the
manual. I want to share this manual with all the hobbysts. Here it is:
