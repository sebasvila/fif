The Boley Leinen lathe acquired a new attachment: an old Waldmann but serious machine lamp (WD 306). I got the lamp from a ebay bid and replaced some of the components that where worn by the use. It was a surprise to discover that Waldmann served the spare parts with no problems although we are facing a really old model. Great!  
  
Here there are a picture of the lamp in place.
