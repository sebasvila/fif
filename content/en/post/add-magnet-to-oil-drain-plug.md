The two speed driver of the lathe runs in an oil bath. Two plugs let to replace the oil when needed. We made two operations with them:  


1.  Adding a neodymium magnet to the draining plug to let it to catch the debris.Â  The magnet is a counterbored ring bought at [Aimangz](https://www.aimangz.es/). The magnet was screwed to the internal part of the plug.
2.  The plus are in a difficult position to be tightened. Thus we decided to make a special screwdriver to facilitate the operation. The screwdriver is adjusted to the plugs and it has a ring to avoid the displacement from the plug cap.


Th next picture shows lft to right the drain plug with the screwed magnet and its copper washer, the fill plug, a counterbored neodymium magnet and the special screwdriver made for the plugs.
