Old mechanical sewing machines are a true gift: robust, nice,
effective and useful. Refurbishing them is, however, not so
easy. Screws, particulary, are most of them made following old norms
or simply following no norms. This is the story of a Singer sewing
machine screw.

I had some previous experience on refurbishing an old Kohler sewing
machine that we received from a relative. The machine supporting
hinges lack a set screw of an unknown thread type. Not an usual metric
or UNF screw. Reading here ans there I finally deduced that it was a
"Nähnorm 100" (see [this
table](https://www.gewinde-normen.de/en/sewing-machine-thread.html
"Nähnorm 100 screws table")) screw, a screws norm used by some
european sewing machine makers.

Some days ago a good friend of mine come with a Singer sewing machine
he found in the trash. He spent some time to recover the machine and
now it is fully operative. He bought an old electrical motor for the
machine. However, an specific screw was needed to attach the motor
bracket to the machine leg. Because of the previous experience I
readily thought it should be an special screw. Some googling after it
was clear that Singer designed its own screws. Some
[tables](https://www.singersewinginfo.co.uk/screw_threads "Singer
screws table") show a large list of usual screws used in Singer
machines. After talking each other we deduced we are talking of Singer
screw number 50632, with a diameter of 9/32 in and 20 tpi.

After some work on the lathe, a new screw was made following the
specifications that fitted satisfactorily to the machine. Following
you can see some pictures of the screw and the sewing machine.
