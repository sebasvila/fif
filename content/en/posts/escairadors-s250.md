The contractor's cabinet saw with sliding table S250 ---made in
Italy--- was bought to the woodworking tools trader [Miquel
Martínez](http://www.miquelmartinez.com) almost as scrap. The seller
was really fair and honest and never tryed to hide the real problems
of the machine. However, I was heavily interested in this given its
dimensions and overall buildin quality.

Moving the machine at home was
done by the seller itself.  This machine is mainly built as a sturdy
steel plate cabinet that supports a cast iron top where the 250mm saw
tilting mechanisms are attached. The machine was clearly abused and
some parts are obviously broken. The motor is burned as the selles
told me. Overhauling it will be a nice project.

# Saw state

This is the saw looking when arrived at the garage:

{{< figure classes="fig-100 clear" thumbnail-with="75%" src="/fotos/escairadora/dsc07644.jpg" >}}

At first sight, the saw do not has major problems. A deep inspection
after arriving home finds the following issues:

* Rust. The machine ---as confirmed by the seller--- was stored
  outside and after that it was subject to a supeficial
  cleaning. There are signs that it has been cleaned by using a steel
  wire brush and maybe a grinder. There remains, however, a lot of
  rust to be treated.
* There is not one of the turning handles. That of the saw tilting
  shaft.
* The tapered end of the missing handle shaft is bent. It seems that
  it received a strong blow that broke the handle and bent the shaft.
* The fence support was broken.
* The motor was burned.
* The sliding table supports were broken. The sliding table is
supported on a shaft through a couple of sliding supports. These
supports were broken.
* The electrical wiring is in bad state.


# Dismantling the saw

I first dismantle the machine. The saw, which is rather heavy, is
moved using a chain hoist and using greased flat bars to slide it
over. See the next picture.

Helped by the hoist, I take out the saw table. The table is bolted to
the cabinet with rubber washes between both parts to compensate for
deformities. The table is turned over a couple of sawhorses.

{{< image classes="fig-100 clear" thumbnail-with="75%" src="/fotos/escairadora/DSC07752.jpg" >}}

Next, the saw moving mechanism is taken apart and cleaned. I separate
the motor and the saw shaft. The saw shaft bearings are replaced.

# Motor

Motor was burned as the seller told me before. A new ABB motor and a
set of new belts where mounted. The pictures below show the original
(italian made) motor an the new one.

# The saw shaft

The saw shaft was supported by two closed bearings. I replaced them by
a couple of new ones. Next pictures show the saw shaft in distinct
phases.

# Shaft lock bar

To lock the saw shaft when you change the saw blade you should use a
specific bar that fits some holes over the shaft pulley. I turned a
lock bar from steel and heat treated it using the oxiacetilene
blowtorch. The following pictures illustrate this process.

# Repair the tilt handle shaft

The tilting handle shaft protrudes at the left of the cabinet but
there is no handle there. Just a bent shaft tappered connection
appears in place. It seems that an important blow had broken the
handle and bent the axle. The handle should be of cast steel not
unlike the blade elevation wheel. I first repair the shaft. I try to
straighten it by heating it and hammering it straight again on the
anvil. Then, I turn it perfect again with the same geometry that the
elevation shaft. See the next pictures.

# Sliding carriage supports

The saw carriage moves over a steel roun bar supported by a tunnable
bearing based supports. The two supports are cast iron and are
broken. There ara traces of having been welded time ago. Thus, they
should be broken several times. To overhaul these supports will be the
most complex task of all the project.

I first made a carefull blueprint using the parts remaining. After
that a wood pattern was made to cast a new set of supports. Casting
was done at [Fonería
Martínez](http://fundicionmartinez.com). After that, parts should be
precisely mechanized on the milling machine. Next pictures document
all this process. Note that it will show also the pattern for the
missing tilt handle.

# Blade box cover plate

The blade box cover plate was missing. I cut a nee one from steel plate.

# Feet and wheels

We add rubber feet and wheels to make easier to move it. The wheels
shafts can be screwed in and ou to allow wheels to be removed
easily. In the pictures you will see the shaper cutting some flats to
the wheel shafts.

# Finishing and paint

Finally, the machine is derusted and the old paint scraped. New
painting process includes applying primer, sanding it, and lackering
with two colors. This ends the project with an fully operating
machine.

This is the finished machine, It works like a clock. It's stable ans
precise. A pleasure to work with.
