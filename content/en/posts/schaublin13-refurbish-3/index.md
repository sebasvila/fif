In this post I talk about the maintenance of the Schaublin 13 table
feed gearbox. It is easy to identify because it protrudes the back of
the machine in an unusual way.

<!--more-->

The Schaublin 13 has a range of automatic table feeds on the X and Z
axis. While feeds are commanded from a kind of «joystick» on the
console front, the speeds gearbox is located on the machine back as
you can see in the next picture:

Note the black knob: it's used to change the feed speeds of the table
movements. It has two ranges and a number of speeds in each range. In
the machine, the knob appears full of oil. Thus, I wanted to check it.
The gearbox gets power from the main motor through a vee belt and
feeds the milling machine console through a shaft that ends in a bevel
gear. In the last picture, you can see the curved form of the machine
main shell that protects the power shaft. Seen from the interior this
is the shaft:

And this is the gearbox pulley ---that is belted to main motor---
while being pulled off:

The gearbox rotates around the power shaft axis. This movement allows
to tension the motor belt. This can be seen on the first picture.

# Dismantle the gearbox

To get the feeds gearbox out of the machine you should first drain the
oil. Surprisingly, I discovered that the gearbox was exceedinlgly full
of oil. I almost recovered 1,2 l of oil. The manual states that you
should fill it with 0,5 l of oil. This was good news: probably it's
the reason because oil spills out by the knob.

After that, you should pull off the pulley. This pulley is maintained
in his shaft by a special locking screw. First you should unlock the
screw by loosening the central Allen set screw, after that the screw
can be unscrewed using a c-hook spanner and the pulley pulled
off. Once the pulley is out just unscrew the gear box and pull it at
hand to get it out of the milling machine.

The following picture shows a detail of the special locking screw. The
stell ball pushes the screw interior, expanding the screw diameter and
locking it:

# Service the knob o-ring

The knob shaft is easy to pull out: just unscrew the retaining set
screw and pull the knob apart. The knob is mounted over a double shaft
to actuate over the two speed ranges. This is an exploded picture of
the knob-shaft assembly:

The current o-ring was of size 23 x 2,5. However, the Freudenberg
calculator gives a thicker dimension. I replaced it by a new o-ring of
the same dimensions that the current one. It is on smooth fit range
but could be enough. The next pricture shows the knob assembly being
pushed again into the gearbox:
