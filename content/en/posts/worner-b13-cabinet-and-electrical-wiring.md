One of this summer works have been to finish the cabinet of the the
Wörner B13 drilling press. It was mainly a work of covering the steel
frame support with MDF. The final desire is to get it prepared to fit
the electrical wiring and a set of drawers to organize the tooling of
the machine.

# Panelling the steel frame

After cutting the main panels, adjusting, and fasten them with
interior screws the frame seems mostly covered:

The next step is to provide an internal support to receive the drawers
and also separate:

*   The control switches space (in the front) and,
*   The VFD and drilling machine pillar space (in the back). It should
    be noted that the drilling machine column protrudes under the
    table when it was at the lowest position.

After adding these elements this is how the cabinet looks:

Some panels and a double hinged door than can be folded over the back
of the cabinet make the final touches:

# Wiring the machine

The machine needs an appropriate set of control switches and the power
control. From the beginning, I decided to run it by using and VFD to
get a better control of the speed without requiring too much belt
changing. The motor and light cables go through the column of the
machine and thus are available in the back part of the cabinet. Of
course, switches should be on the front...

The design of the control panel includes:

*   A general switch for the mains supply.
*   A pilot light.
*   A forward pushbutton and a reverse pushbutton.
*   A stop pushbutton.
*   A switch for the machine light.
*   A 10 positions rotary switch to select speed. I use a binary coded
    switch: this reduces the number of control wires and is compatible
    with the VDF control.

The control panel was an aluminium plate that I conveniently drilled
and painted to RAL Reseda Green to match the machine hue. The panel
was attached to the cabinet front and made accessible through a window
cut in the MDF:

As seen in the last pictures, another aluminium panel was used as a
support and as a cooling element of the VDF. This other panel was
attached in a similar way to the back of the cabinet. The following
pictures show the front and back with the wiring finished:

Note that the cabinet back was supported also by hinges. This allows
for an easier work when adjusting or programming the
VFD. Additionally, I added an absorber to avoid oil coming from the
column to go over the VFD.

This is how the machine looks with all the MDF varnished and the
electrical panels mounted:

# Adding a set of drawers

Next step was to add a set of drawers running on over extended
slides. I choose medium duty [Thomas Regout ball bearing
slides](https://www.thomasregout-telescopicslides.com/) that were
bought in [guiastelescopicas.com](http://guiastelescopicas.com)

Drawers were built with MDF and plywood at very precise dimensions to
fulfill the narrow requirements of ball bearing guides. Guides were
aligned by using a scrap wood made jig that was cut to match the next
guides level. A self made centering punch for counterbored holes was
also used to precisely center the screws.

Overall, the result was really satisfactory as you can see in these

Note that the first drawer has a bigger space to allow the storage of
vertically positioned drilling bits... but this will be the subject of
a new post!!
