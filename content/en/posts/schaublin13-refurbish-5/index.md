The last post discovered the Y axis ram problems. In this post I
explain how the aligment problems were (partially) solved. This is the
result of a long journey through geometry and aligment testing,
scraping learning and lots of patience.

<!--more-->

The main conclusions of last post was that the milling machine shows a
significative wear on the ways of the Y ram. As a result, the play in
the horizontal plane of the ram was sensible and, additionally, an
undesired rotation is observed when the Y displacement is reversed.

# Scraping practice and basic tools

First action was to gather some needed tools and learn to get flat
surfaces by scraping. Tools are essential to further investigate were
the real problem is in the ram ways. Scraping is essential to get some
of the tools at a reasonable price and to refurbish the ways after the
issue is well defined.

I will avoid the details of all the stuff concerning scraping practice
in this post and write a specific post in some weeks.

Finally, after some months, I ended with a slight experience in
scraping and some useful tools. Mainly a precision surface plate, a
magnetic master square, some straight edges, scrapers, scraper
grinding tool, and spotting ink. Below, there are some pictures of
them.


# First tests with the new tools

The first test concerned the orthogonality of the Y ways with the
Z. Using the magnetic master square this was easy to check:

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="yz-test.jpg" >}}

The result was the ram is climbing 0.01 mm over the square plane
defined by Z ways. This is uninteresing. In fact, if the ram had beed
sagging 0.01 mm ---instead of climbing-- would have been much better.

Thus, there are also some wear on the flat part of the Y ways. It
would be miraculous that flat parts of the way were pristine while the
dovetail flats were weared.

To add information a new test is made. A small surface plate is blued
with spotting kink and the flat static ways spotted as shown in the
next picture:

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="spot-static.jpg" >}}

the result obtained is this:

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="spot-static-result.jpg" >}}

Note the following:

1. The original scraping marks are clear and correspond to a classical
   european technique: "grattage a l'Ã©paule". Most of swiss machines
   are scraped using this technique.

2. It's is clear that the central part of the guides are scraped
   slightly deeper. This is an usual and reported technique in the
   literature. The shorter part of the ways could be scraped following
   this pattern. The central part is depressed an small amount, say
   0.005 mm. First, the depressed part acts as an oil reservoir that results
   in a better oiling of the ways. Second, the ways should work on its
   ends to achieve the better support of the ram. Considering that a
   perfect plan is impossible to achieve, is better to depress the
   center to avoid a convex profile that would be unstable.

3. Note that the left (in the picture) flat is much wider than the
   right. This is the flat that has the screw slot. This slow reduces
   the supporting surface. This was compensated by designing a wider
   flat.

4. The spotting shows a contact that, although no perfect, could be
   good enough. The greatest wear is in the back part of the
   guides. This surprised me but is consistent with the climbing that
   exhibits in the previous test.

The next test was to check the dovetail of the ram. Using the angular
straight edge conveniently inked the result is shown in the next
picture:

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="dovetail-spotting.jpg"
>}}

The result is clear. There is a considerable wear on the central part
of the dovetail. The result for the other side was similar to this
one.

I also checked the static part of the dovetail an the gib (see picture
below). The result was that both gib and fix dovetail follow the
"center depressed pattern" as seen on flats and both showed some
degree of wear as expected.

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="gib-wear.jpg" >}}

From all this information I designed the next workplan.


# Workplan

I followed this workplan:

1. Above all do not exhaust the adjusting capability of the gib. Every
   time you reduce the thickness of an element by scraping it, you
   will need to increase the gib action. The gib, however, have a
   limit to compensate the scraped elements: about 10mm of lineal
   movement at its maximum, what means approximately 0,12 mm of
   dovetail thickness. If while modifying geometry this limit is
   surpased, a new gib would be necessary. I didn't want to fit a new
   gib. Thus, this sets a limit on all the procedure.

2. Mostly ignore the flats. From the tests, the main wear comes frome
   the dovetail. Then, sacrifice the flats perfection to favor the gib
   conservation. At most, lightly scrape the static flats to increase
   the contact points in the ends of the guide.

3. Try to reduce the wear of the ram dovetail. Maybe, to save the gib,
   allow a small imperfection on the deepest wear point if this do not
   influences the ram displacement quality.

4. Scrape the dovetail static part to achieve a depressed middle an a
   nice ends contact.

5. Maintain a very good paralelism with the shaft of the machine and
   reduce as much as possible the play in the horizontal plane of the
   ram.


# Results obtained

The dovetail of the ram has been scraped until obtaining a new
surface. Most of the worn part has been overhauled. The gib advanced
about 4 mm and maybe 4 mm more are available for future
adjustments. To check the parallelism of the ram dovetails, a gig
shown in the next picture have been made. Note that measuring using
pins is not possible due to the slot that contains the feed screw
(slightly visible on the farthest flat).

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="mes-paral.jpg" >}}

Play in the horizontal plane has been reduced to 0.002 - 0.004 mm
range. Play when changing the displacement direction of the ram
amounts 0.01 mm at most. Parallelism of ways with the machine shaft is
in the range 0.002 - 0.004 mm. Squareness of Y and Z has not been
modified and remains an error of 0.01 mm.

The following vids show the current play when changing
direction. First in 1/100 mm and after in 1/1000 mm.


{{< youtube NCaREnbypbs >}}


{{< youtube 4eEQD6Y4wQw >}}


The condition has been vastly improved on the horizontal plane while
on the vertical plane the error remains. This is consistent because
the flats have not been scraped.

I didn't find a way to go further. My guess is that without work on
the flat parts of the ways is difficult to obtain better results
because of the influence of the flats on the dovetail adjustment. I do
not reject to work on the flats in a future.


# A fascinanting question about geometry

Assume that the Y ram is a 2-dimensional mechanism and that there is
no way to get a perfect fit of the ways. Then, because the push/pull
action of the feed screw i asymmetrical, a rotation of the ram exists
when changing feed direction. Consider the next drawing:

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="comp-hor.png" >}}

On the left figure, you can see the ram position when moving back to
front. The feed screw action is represented in orange. In blue, you
see a tentative center of mass and the rotation induced by the feed
screw action. Thus, the contact points of the ram on its guides are
the red dot and the ram should mostly glide by the thicker grey line.
The right figure shows a similar situation when ram is moving front to
back.

Note that when you change the ram direction, a rotation appears that
goes from the current situation to its complementary. This is what is
observed when measuring.

Assuming this behavior, how much can be reduced this measured
rotation?
