The Wörner quill is again on the drilling press. After being
completely cleaned and disassembled, the quill rack was touched up to
correct the damage that probably was made while assembling the pinion
some time ago. Main bearings were replaced by a new ones. Old ones
have a suspicious mark that suggest they are no plain 6006 deep grove
bearings. [GMN](https://www.gmn.de) redirected me to the spanish
contact [Berkomat](https://www.berkomat.com) and they concluded that
class P4 6005 bearings would be the right replacement. New bears were
fitted again by freezing first the spindle to facilitate the task.


The rear bearing was thoroughly cleaned with gasoline after getting
out the seals and regreased.


All the pack was mounted inside the quill with a smooth movement. On
the rear bearing, the spindle set is retained by a succession of two
belleville washers a grinded spacer washer and a DIN 471 retaining
washer. Overall, this set of washers gives the bearings a preload that
copes with the play of the spindle and the temperature variations. I
was worried about the method to maintain the belleville's pressed
while I put the retaining washer. It was easier than expected and in
one minute things were at place.


Here there are some pictures of the parts while being assembled:
