Painting works are coming to the end. Last days I finally got some
lack cans to do the final coating. Not an easy task due to COVID'19
lock down. I sprayed most the prepared parts and this is the result:

Overall, the finish quality is really good. The enamel used is of
semi-gloss sheen and gives a really silky touch to the surface.
  
As I mentioned in the [previous post]({{< ref "worner-b13-paint-works"
>}}), the base suffered of cracking defects that worsened as the
layers become drier (it lasts about three days to fully dry).  I
should decide what to do with this issue. Here you can see some
detailed pictures of the defects:
