One of the jobs done this summer is a special square intended to
facilitate the alignment of the grinder axis. I own a Klaiber WSII
tool grinder. This grinder has a head with several degrees of freedom
and aligning it to the table is not easy given the poor quality of the
head scales. Thus, I decided to build a particular square that fits in
the head nose and offers a reference plane to test with the indicator
or the protractor, for instance. This is a picture of the finished
square:

As you can see in the picture, the queue of the square is a 317E
collet fitting the Klaiber nose. A bigger disk was attached to this
queue by shrink fitting. The fit was designed following the rule that
says: «add 0.001 x D to the diameter D of the shaft; make the hole to
dimension». Then, the shaft was turned to 16.02 mm and the hole to
16.00mm. Shaft was put into the freezer and the plate heated with an
air heater. Shaft introduced into the hole with no pressure in this
conditions.

The queue was turned according to collet dimensions and lapped to
14.99 mm. The collet I got with the grinder measures 14.97mm. I think
it is a bit undersized despite being an original one. The following
two pictures show the result of the lapping:

You can see that the shank tapers off 0.006mm. I considered it's
enough for the purpose. I guess that it would have diminished by a
better lapping procedure. The collet queue was finished by threading
and cutting the slot.  After that, the plate was carefully faced. It
was not an easy job given the diameter ratios that induced a tendency
to chatter. After that, the plate was lapped to a smooth and flat
surface. I end this entry with couple more of pictures of the square
and a final picture of the square fitted in the grinder head.
