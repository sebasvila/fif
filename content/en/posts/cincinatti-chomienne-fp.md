The milling machine Cincinnati-Chomienne FP30
---------------------------------------------


This entry describes the milling machine Cincinnati-Chomienne model
FP30. It has served me a number of years but now it's on
sale. Literature on this machine is scarce. I found only manuals for
similar Cincinnati-Chomienne machines and a brochure for this machine
that shows its main dimensions.


The milling machine is built in France in the late 60's (acording to
the plate the april of 1968). It is a light milling machine, although
capable, and it also serves very well as a drilling machine. The
machine can be described as a vertical drilling/milling machine.

The next pictures show the milling machine general character:

This is its identification plate:



{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/cincinnati/P1060050.JPG" thumbnail-with="75%" >}}


And this are the main dimensions as provided by an original brochure:





As you can see, it is very generous on its working lengths. It should
be emphasized the very long Z travel!.

Additionally, these are the most salient characteristics:


*   Spindle with ISO 30 cone
*   A quill travel of 120mm
*   Spindle speeds from 125 to 5000 rpm
*   Main motor power 1,5 HP
*   The spindle drive is a belt variator. No gearing involved. Thus, it runs very silently.
*   Head can be inclined till 60 degrees.
*   The quill can be displaced by a handle (fast) and by a worm gear (slow). This allows for drilling and reaming easily.
*   All graduated drums read in 0,02 mm, including the slow quill displacement.
*   There is a motorised X travel unit. The distinct speeds are achieved by changing a pair of gears.


The spindle driving unit
------------------------


The spindle is directly driven by a belt variator. There is no gearing
involved. Thus, it is a very silent machine even at high speeds. The
variator can be used in two range of speeds by changing the belts
appropiately. The intermediate pulley moves back and forth by the
action of a handle in the front of the machine and, at the same time,
an indicator moves over a plate showing the approximate rpm's of the
spindle.

Following there are a couple of pictures of the spindle drive system.

Note that belts were replaced recently and they are new. The range of
speeds spans from 125 to 5000 rpm.



The quill displacement
----------------------


The machine head has a quill mechanism that allows for vertical travel
of about 120mm. Note that most milling machines of this size have a
quill travel, if any, of about 60mm. This is the case for Sixis 103,
Schaublin 13 or Deckel FP1. The quill can be locked in any position by
a clamp. Also, there is a usual depth max and min stops. The picture
below shows the quill at maximum extension. Observe that the inferior
depth stop includes an o-ring that avoids the quill to hit the bracket
when returning because of the spring.

The quill can be actuated by two mechanisms. The first is an ordinary
feed handle that directly actuates on the pinion and rack usual
assembly. This mechanism allows for a rapid but controlled descent of
the spindle and it is used to drilling like operations.

In the second one the pinion is rotated by a worm drive actuated
through a hand wheel. This gives a much more slow movement suitable
for boring like operations. This second mechanism can be engaged by
rotating the eccentric suport of the worm until no play is
appreciated. The hand wheel have a measuring drum graduated in
0.02mm. The following picture shows ths slow mechanism.

The shaft of the pinion also contains, enclosed in a box, a spring to
return the quill to its neutral position. This box is graduated in its
exterior and it allowsÂ  to read in a Vernier scale to a resolution of
0.1 mm as it can be seen in the picture below. This is a really useful
measuring device.

The automatic X travel
----------------------


The X axe travel of this machine can be feed by an automatic
mechanism. It is driven by an autonomous small motor that can be
started in both directions through a switch next to the table. The
traveling speed is modified by replacing a couple of gears enclosed in
a box. Each pair of gears can be reversed and thus three pairs of
gears result in six traveling speeds as shown in the corresponding
plate.

Unfortunately the machine was arrived with only two gears: 73 and
20. With this pair of gears, only the maximum and the minimum
traveling speed can be achieved. What follows are some pictures of the
advance mechanism. The last one shows the gearbox open. Note that
travel speed is set at the lowest velocity.

The rotation of the head
------------------------


The head of the milling machine is built like a giant hinge. This can
be seen in the general pictures shown before. This allows the head to
be rotated around the "pivot". In this case, the pivot is a heavy
cilinder of about 120mm of diameter perfectly fitted. The inclination
can be read in a scale as you can see in the next picture:



{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/cincinnati/P1060058.JPG" thumbnail-with="75%" >}}


To rotate the head is a heavy work given the weight of it. However,
it's made easy by means of a worm that slowly rotates the head. The
worm gear is actuated by a square ended stud in one side of the
head. Once rotated, the head can be locked in its position by a couple
of clamps that are actuated through square ended studs. The next
picture shows the head inclined 30 degrees:



{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/cincinnati/P1060084.JPG" thumbnail-with="75%" >}}



To return the head at the zero position, there is a positioning
conical plunger that, when properly set up, gives a perfect vertical
position. Obviously, this plunger should extracted before turning the
head. This is done by a useful nut that acts as an extractor. The
picture below shows this plunger.

The quill and the spindle
-------------------------


Maybe a year ago I fully serviced the quill and spindle mechanism: I
replaced the bearings that support the driving pulley, cleaned and
relubed the spindle bearings and readjusted them. What follows are
some pictures obtained during this work.

Literature about this milling machine
-------------------------------------


As said before, I don't know any literature about this machine other than the brochure shown in the first section. However, there are some manuals of similar machines also built by Cincinnati-Chomienne (later as Cincinnati-Milacron) that share many building blocks withs this one. The most salient are:


* [Cincinnati-Milacron PF26 manual](/pdfs/PF26complet.pdf)
* [Cincinnati PF25 manual](/pdfs/cinncinati-pf25.pdf)
