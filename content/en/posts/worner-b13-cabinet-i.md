The first work we do is a spcific cabinet to support the drill press, to protect the electrical wiring and, to store the drill tooling. The cabinet structure is maid from steel L profile of 50mm conveniently welded. It is mounted on machine feet ans designed to be moved by using the palet jack.  
  
Below you will find some pictures of the structure and the drill press being moved on its top. Note that the drill press column dives into the table and thus the top cover should be bored accordingly. The coating is Reseda Green (RAL 6011) enamel, which matches the original drill press color.
