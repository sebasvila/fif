The first work we do is a specific cabinet to support the drill press,
to protect the electrical wiring and, to store the drill tooling. The
cabinet structure is maid from steel L profile of 50mm conveniently
welded. It is mounted on machine feet ans designed to be moved by
using the palet jack.

Below you will find some pictures of the structure and the drill press
being moved on its top. Note that the drill press column dives into
the table and thus the top cover should be bored accordingly. The
coating is Reseda Green (RAL 6011) enamel, which matches the original
drill press color.
