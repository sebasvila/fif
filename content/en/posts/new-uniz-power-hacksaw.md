feb 21 we have been in Juncosa (Les Garrigues) to buy an old Uniz
power hacksaw. It is a model 1 Uniz saw of 14 in built in the Basque
country around the 60's. The saw is really sturdy with a weight of
more than 300 kg. It was kindly transported by my brother
[Jordi](http://www.argotphoto.com/).

I left here a couple of pictures of the machine just arrived:
