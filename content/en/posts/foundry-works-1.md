During the last months I've been helping Luke Rickert ---of
[Elisenberg Engineering](https://www.elisenbergengineering.com)--- to move
forward a foundry project. I had a limited experience on foundry
business that comes from the [rebuilding of a cabinet saw]({{< relref
"escairadors-s250">}}) and Luke's project became a really
interesting experience.

All begins when Luke asked me about foundries in Catalonia. He
currently lives in southern France and he is really close to catalan
speaking lands.

# Classic patterns

Luke has some ideas to cast some straight edges and also some
worktable vices. After considering this possibility Luke sent me some
3D printed patterns of his designs.

I asked about to [Foneria
Martínez](http://fundicionmartinez.com/menu_eng.HTM) and returned with
a negative answer from them. They don't cast anymore using classical
patterns!  They suggested me to use pattern plates instead.

# Pattern plates: first version

I brought a couple of old plates that foundry guy give us to know the
plate dimensions. The plates where reworked to be reused.

The plate dimensions, in this case, are written to this
[blueprint](/pdfs/mold-plate-dimensions.pdf).

Luke designed some runners and some risers to complete the plates for
the vices and also mechanized two more plates for the straight
edges. After gluing all the parts and smoothing them this was the
result:

{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/placa1-se.jpg" >}}
{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/placa2-se.jpg" >}}

The plates were painted with "VIETOR Vitolux Modellack B33", a specific paint
for foundry patterns. The paint sovent are aggresive and unfortunately
softened the filler used to smooth the corners. The result wasn't the
best as it can be seen the the following picture:

{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/canals-se.jpg">}}

Note that the straight edges cope plate was unusually thick to allow
the milling of pockets. That was agreed before with the foundry. When
plates where ready I bring them to the foundry... but they refused to
cast them :flushed:. Two main problems where detected by the foundry guy
just looking at them:

* Bad surface quality (remember the painting issues)
* Too complex runners; too organic shape and excessive volume.

# Pattern plates: second version

Plates were modified conveniently to solve the main issues. Fine
woodwoking, new runners design, carefull filling and sanding and,
finally, lackering them again as shown in next pictures:

>}}
{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/plaques-se-2-joc.jpg" >}}

The plates were carried again to the foundry and a small set of parts
to test them ordered. This time the result was better. Here are the
grey iron parts cast:

# Stress relieving the straight edges

Straight edges need to be as stable as possible. Thus, a stress
relieving treatment is mandatory. The thermal treatment was done by
[Tractaments Tèrmics Carreras](http://www.grupttc.com).

# Pattern plates: third version

After the examination of the test parts and a friendly talk with the
foundry guys, several improvements arouse.

* Reinforce the location holes of the plates that have been destroyed
  by the sand shaking machinery.

    {{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/forat-destruit.jpg" >}}

* Reinforce the crest of the straight edge drag plate: the moulding
  stress produces small breaks there.

    {{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/aresta-1.jpg" >}}
    {{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/aresta-2.jpg" >}}

* Reduce the gates section of the runners to achieve a better input
  stream characteristics into the mould cavity when pouring the
  steel. This should avoid this slight defect in the casting:

  {{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/minva-1.jpg" >}}

Also, from milling a test straight edge, it was clear that some more
material will be needed and thus wall thickness should be increased.

To reinforce location holes, Luke turned a set of bushes to be screwed
in place. I made a jig to precisely place the bushes on the
plates. And using this jig bushes were screwed on.

{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/utillatge-1.jpg" >}}

To compensate weared wood on the used plates and to further strenght the
locating bushes, I filled the gaps with epoxi:

{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/epoxi.jpg" >}}

We also attached lateral reinforcement steel strips to the
plates. These strips protect the plate against the sandbox walls.

The straight edge drag was enlarged by attaching a piece of beech that
also solved the crest strongness issue:

{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/beech-2.jpg" >}}
{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/beech-3.jpg" >}}

Next, the gates were reworked on the straight edge cope:

{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/foneria/gates.jpg" >}}

Finally, plates were lackered again and pin nailed (see the picture)
to mark how cope and draw should be matched each other. This was teh result:
