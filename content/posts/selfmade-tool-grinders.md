An interesting machine any workshop needs is a tool grinder. In the
net it's possible to find information about many home made tool
grinders (or tool grinding gigs). Most of the designs have known names
related to the design author. This blog entry is the result of
collecting some of the designs to build a small tool grinder for the
workshop. Any suggestion about a missing design will be considered ;-).


The Quorn design
----------------

{{< image classes="fig-100 clear"  src="/fotos/unclass/quorn-full.png" thumbnail-with="75%" >}}

This "the" classic home made grinder. Designed by D. H. Chaddock and
published through his book ["The Quorn tool and cutter
grinder".](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL13223812W/The_Quorn_tool_and_cutter_grinder)
It's design seems inspired in some classical cutter grinders like
[Deckel SO](http://www.lathes.co.uk/deckel/page3.html).

It's not easy to build. A hobbist that  achieves its construction
earns an automatic recognition in the community. There is a lot of
information about this design. Indeed there are kit sellers for the
castings and blueprints. Some interesting references are:

The majority of Quorn grinders are made using specific castings. These
castings are mostly bought at specialized providers. However, some of
the Quorns are built from stock bar. Bonelle design is one of these:

The Brooks-Stent design
-----------------------

This design looks like a miniaturized [Clarkson
grinder](http://www.lathes.co.uk/clarkson).  Brooks grinder was
published in Model Engineering Workshop numbers 16 and 17.

The Kennet design
-----------------


An easier design that the previous ones.

The Worden
----------

A design similar to that of Kennet but simpler. It is mostly built by
using steel plate and the spindle is avoided by directly using the
motor shaft.

Grinder jigs
------------


There is a variety of grinding gigs mostly used for grinding lathe tools.
