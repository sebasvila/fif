1. It has an overall nice contition and there is no excessive wear in
   any of the mechanisms. The machine looks very well made. There are
   many quality details and no efforts have been economized when
   building it.
2. The handle of the cross slide is bent. The shaft is also bent. It
   seems that the handle received an importat blow.
3. There is a layer of badly applyed paint over the original
   coating. The color do not match the original one.
4. The main switch is not the original one. By some reason it was
   replaced.
5. It has an original coolant tank and pump with a deficient
   electrical wiring.
6. The tool slide driving screw has an important backlash and turning
   it reveals some friction points.
7. The carriage has some threaded holes to attach tooling that lack
   the protection setscrews.
