The Wörner B13 has a notable building quality. It's not cheap machine
at all. After the disassembly, al mechanical elements were cleaned of
debris and this olde grease that forms a kind of hard lack with
years. Surely, the machine was serviced before: there are traces of
poor repairing and assembly. I'm not sure, however, that it was also
cleaned and relubed. Grease looks very old in some bearings.

What follows are some detailed pictures of the distinct assemblies
after cleaning the parts. Some of them show a remarkable quality.

This is the driving shaft that conduces the spindle and supports the
driven pulley. A couple of deep grove ball bearings (6005 and 6007)
support the shaft, which is splined in its interior. The housing fits
into the quill bore.

This is the spindle assembly. The spindle ends in a Morse 2 tapper. In
this end, it is mounted on three bearings. Two deep grove ball
bearings and an axial ball bearing. Bearings are of series 6005 but
actual precision of them is unknown to me. It seems they are not
current series bearings. The opposite end is held by a 6004
bearing. All the pack is preloaded by two cup washers locked by a
retaining ring DIN 471.  The runout of the spindle before servicing
was around to 0.005mm.

This is a picture of the quill with the spindle and the descent
gear. Note the rack dimensions and the fact that it is of helical
kind. Pinion shaft is mounted on bearings.

The pinion shaft shows a rather unusual detail: pinion is of a zero
play kind. There is a parted pinion with a spring in between that
allows for a non play quill descent mechanism. Note the big smooth
flange in the left pinion part that facilitates the assembly to the
rack.

This is the belt tensioner mechanism. Note that it runs with a rack
and pinion, which is not an cheap at all to build.

The drilling depht indicator and stop.

This is the assembly that is used to raise and lower the machine
head. Again it is built around a rack and pinion basis. The rack end
has tooth in the back that sustains the drilling head column and lets
the operator to raise it. Note that the pinion is turned by a
worm. All this assembly is mounted on the column suport attached to
the drilling table.
