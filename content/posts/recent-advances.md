There has been not many advances during last weeks, However, the lathe
bed has been cleaned and prepared to be lacquered as show in the
following pictures.

We also worked on the lathe head, cleaning it and polishing the
handles, After painting it again I replaced a couple of oil level
screens and filled the spindle oil dwells. The result was that the
back dwell has a mall oil leakage. It should be repaired.
Here there are a couple of pictures of the lacquered headstock:
