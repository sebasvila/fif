Here I face to recover the original aspect of the Schaublin 13. I will
try to preserve original colors and distributions and, to some extent,
the original coating where possible.

# Which is the state of the Schaublin coating

The machine has a three colors scheme.

1. There is an «internal» coating that is used to protect the hidden
   interiors: the main casting interior, the internal faces of the
   sliding apron, etc. This is a kind of aluminium based coating of a
   thick feeling. I cannot precisely identify it.

2. There is a plain grey that is used along the main column and
   support. The coating is non-sensible to the solvent test. Thus it
   is a king of resistent coating. It exhibits a good aspect apart
   from the chips tray, that is moderately affected by the use. The
   precise grey is a difficult matter. For sure it is no RAL color
   according to may chart.

3. There is also a hammered effect coating that is used along the
   apron, the tables and the head. Also some tooling and the
   electrical cabinet uses this paint. On many posts this is described
   as silver color but ---at least in my machine--- it is not exactly
   a pure silver. It has a hue with some green component and maybe
   other tertiary components. This gives a more «sophisticated» feel.

4. The color of the handles cannot be appreciated. The use have eroded all
   traces of it. In some sense it remembers the internal coating.


# The coating scheme to be used

I decided to overhaul the coatings in the Schaublin using this path:

1. Internal coating will be redone just in special cases. For sure,
   the interior of the main casting will not be painted again. Where
   needed, I will use the same coating that in the case of handles.

2. The plain gray will be determined by the paint supplier to get a
   best match color. I want to use 2K polyurethane enamel to have a
   chemical resistent coating.

3. The hammered paint parts will be coated with a home mixed hammered
   enamel to match the original color. I will use a «Hammerite» like
   product. It has a good resistance and it is easy to apply.

4. Handles will be painted using a plain finish «Hammerite» like
   enamel of a light grey color.


# The hammered finish enamel

The hammered coat used was a mix of «gris plata» and «verde seda» of
[Oxiron
martelé](https://www.titanlux.es/en/productos/producto/hammered-oxiron-indoors-outdoors-metallic-gloss-hammered). Just
a small amount of green was added to approximate the original
Schaublin tone. The resulting match was rather good. Paint was applied
by brush. The picture below shows the Z axis handle support after
painted.

Other parts originally painted with hammered finish have been also
newly painted. These include the apron and its auxiliary covers and
boxes as shown in next pictures.

# The clear enamel of handles

Handles have been coated with [smooth gloss
Oxiron](https://www.titanlux.es/en/productos/producto/smooth-oxiron-indoors-outdoors-gloss)
of color «gris perla». The picture below shows the handle of the Z
axis.

# The main grey tone

The main grey tone of the machine was matched against a rather extense
sample collection by Torrents Autocolor, that is my usual provider of
painting products. A very close, but not perfect, match was found. To
test it, they prepared a small brush cap bottle of enamel:

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="ampolleta.jpg" >}}

Applied over the original pint, the result is realy close as can be
seen in this picture:

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="mostra-color.jpg" >}}

Unfortunately, the precise hue cannot be shared because the provider
use an internal reference instead of a standard color specification.


# Paint rollers, spray cans and guns

I was commited to give the grey tone parts a good appearance as it is
suposed to have a Schaublin machine :-). I have a good experience with
fine pore foam rollers in the past. However, the coating I'm using is
really aggresive with the foam and makes difficult to do a good job
with it. In the last machine I rebuilt, I used paint spray cans with a
nice result: not very expensive, precise tone and, very convenient to
apply and manage. Thus, I wanted too try spray cans with PUR
coating. The experience deserves some comments.

There are two kind of 2K PUR spray cans: say pre-mixed and on-time
mixed. My coatings provider can prepare both kinds with any custom
color and with any gloss level.

Pre-mixed cans are filled with the PUR base, the hardener and a
component that retains the hardener effect until paint is
sprayed. Then, the can has a log pot live. Paint applyed well
enough. The result, however, was upsetting. After a long period of
curing, the coating was very sensible to chemical agents and not very
scratch resistant. Even a drop of alcohol was able to dissolve the
coating. I would say it was worst than usual alkyd enamel.

On-time cans have a double compartment. One contains the PUR base and
the other contains the hardener. Both can be mixed by a mechanical
action that destroys the comparments bulkhead. This is usually done by
acting on the bottom of the can. This makes this kind of cans easyly
identified. In this case, the experiment was much more successful. The
coating dryed faster ---although not very fast---, and after the
curing time the coating was much more resistent to scratches and usual
chemical products. However, cans are really expensive, coating is not
so hard as a home mixed PUR uses to be and pot live is short ---it
lasts some days---.

The picture below shows the bottom of a on-time can: you can see the
mechanism to destroy the internal bulkhead and activate the hardener.

After all these tests, I decided to fall back into the classical
mix-yourself-and-gun-spray-it procedure.


# Painting guns and compressor

I have some experience using a spray gun long time ago. I applyed PUR
varnish to many of my furniture. Result was good enough, but I learned
that you need an important air flow achieve good results. Things in
this area have improved: the transfer ratio of guns is much better,
partially by the environmental regulations. So, I was determined to
find a small, low flow and high transfer ratio spry gun to replace my
old Sata.

After reading and looking here and there I got a cheap [Iwata
AZ4](https://anest-iwata.com.au/products/spray-guns/gravityspraygun/az4). A
first sight when arrived confirms that it is not the best well
finished gun nor the best material at all. I mounted the AZ1 1.3mm cap
and needle. Despite the quality, the gun is impressive when used. At 1
bar it sprays very nicely and makes easy to get very good and smooth
surfaces. Air consumtion is really low. A 1 KW compressor is
absolutely enough to drive the gun. It has a fan size perfectly well
suited to small and medium size machines we are used to overhaul. The
transfer ratio is really good and almost no paint fog floats in the
air. I really recommend it.

To test the gun, I have given a new layer of paint to the milling
machine Waldmann lamp. I previously used it to test the on-time PUR
can. The result was very satifying. It can be seen on the next
pictures.

# Paint the main casting

Finally, I painted all the main casting. First, the oil bassin is
prepared and painted. Then, all the casting ---including the bassin--
is prepared and painted with two layers of 2K PU coating. Below, you
can see some pictires of the overall process.

This is the result.
