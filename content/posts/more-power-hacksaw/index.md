The work on the power hacksaw is slowly moving forward. The saw was
completely disassembled and cleaned. It was really dirty, full of
chips and old grease. Just to show the state, look at the cutting
fluid tank absolutely full of chips. The last owner shouldn't be very
proud of it...

After disassembling, the general state observed is good enough for a
maybe 50 or 60 years old saw. Most of sliding parts are well
fitted. However we observed a worn wrist pin. We turned a new thick
pins using AISI O2 steel. After that, it has been heat treated and
fitted to size. Here you have a picture of an old wrist pin (on top)
and its replacement:

The other part worn is the big bronze nut of the feed screw. It is an
ACME nut of 1 1/4in and 6tpi. There is no replacement part and is a
complex part to mechanize. We will try to run the saw without
replacing it and decide according to the results. This is a picture of
this nut:

# Painting the saw

The saw will be painted with the original colors. After looking at a
RAL using a part that retains the original painting we decided that
the original color was RAL 7012 (basalt grey), a rather dark grey. The
saw was scrapped, coated with a single component primer ([todoterreno
beisier](http://www.beissier.es/media/documents/beissier/fichas_t_cnicas/FT_TODO_TERRENO.pdf))
and then smoothed with putty filler before applying primer again:

Finally, we painted it with some coats of enamel. We used
[BESA-VAL](http://www.bernardoecenarro.com/en/productos/urki-system/1k-spray-gun-enamels/qd-industrial-paint-besa-val)
industrial enamel. Here you can see the firsts results:
