The lathe arrived, as usual, without any kind of documentation. In
some pages on the net there are partial copies of documentation of
similar models.

Conversations with Tony from [lathes.uk](http://www.lathes.co.uk/)
ended with the purchase of a set of documents for the Leinen LZ4S
lathe, which is not exactly the same machine. The deal with Tony was
perfect and he sent a copy of the manual and also a catalog of
accessories, a verification sheet in which they appear the factory
tolerances of a similar lathe and an original catalog. All correctly
bound. A fantastic documentation.

The differences between the documentation machine and the one we are
overhauling are several. Essentially, the machine we repair:

* Has a spindle nose DIN 55022 number 4.
* It has a graduated dial in the carriage handwheel.
* The spindle mounts precision tapered bearings instead of plain bronze.

After asking if anyone on any forum had the exact manual for the
model, I contacted [FKW-Kilgenstein](http://www.fkw-gmbh.de/), that
offer spare parts for this type of machine. After talking with them,
they sent a manual (in German) corresponding to the precise model
of lathe.
