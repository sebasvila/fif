The Boley Leinen collets have been a controversial issue. Sometimes
difficult to find in a good condition but available time to
time. There are no public Boley Leinen information about the right
collets to be used. This poses some questions that owners are solving
as the time goes. This post shows what collets are and features the
most interesting information about them.

# I Got Them

Time ago, I acquired an almost complete set of collets for the Leinen
lathe. It was achieved through a rather unusual offer in german
ebay. After an year following ebay and other forums looking for Leinen
collets the last week I found an almost complete set in good condition
and including the draw bar. It was really an incredible discovery. I
found no traces of leinen collets during a year and suddenly it
appeared an entire set of them.


# What Are Collets For?

(After some questions of my nephews Martí and Bernat)

The [collets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collet) are devices
designed to precisely hold work in a lathe. Usually every size and
profile of work require a specific collet and thus it is an expensive
system. However it has a number of advantages that makes the system
preferred in some conditions. This advantages include:

* Quick changeover time
* Great accuracy
* Low mass and thus better conditioned to high speeds
* No marks left on the turned part

This is a draw-in collet:

    title="A draw-in collet" >}}

The collet is fitted in an accurate lathe nose as shown in this
picture:

{{< figure src="P1040878.JPG" >}}

The collet is draw from behind using a draw-bar as this one:

{{< figure  src="P1040876.JPG" 
    title="A drawbar to pull the collet and close it" >}}

The draw bar is tightened and it presses the frontal cone of the
collet against the lathe nose:

A perfectly round part can be hold in the collet as shown here:

Here you can see the headstock with the draw bar and a collet holding
a milling cutter:

The collet can be a very accurate holding device. In this picture woy
can see the maximum deviation of this collet. It is near 0.01mm of
excenticity.

The nose can held other tools in addition to collets. Here, for
instance, it holds a dead center that have the same shape that the
collets.

# The Set of Collets

The set is composed by:

1.  A set of 363E draw-in round collets from 1mm to 22mm in 0.5mm
    steps but the 20mm collet that was missing. The collets in the set
    are probably manufactured by three firms. Appoximately a half of
    them are marked «boley-leinen». Collets are used but in a very
    good condition.
2.  A dead center. It is an original boley-leinen center, a standard
    accessory of the Leinen LZ4SB.
3.  A special driver. Although it has no mark it was probably made by
    boley-leinen too. This kind of driver appears in the leinen
    catalog and it is used to drive taps an dies, Remember that this
    kind of collets can also be used in some turret lathe special
    attachments that were sold for the Leinen LZ4.
4.  A draw bar that fits in the Leinen LZ4SB spindle.

Below there are some pictures of the complete set and the special driver:

# The Boley Leinen Collets Standard

Which is the standard of Boley Leinen collets? In Boley Leinen
catalogs the LZ4xx lathes collets are always referenced as **s25**
collets. It is an in-company reference but it is not clear if
corresponds to a known standard. Many colleagues in the past thought
that draw-in collets match the [numbered series 363E
](https://shop.f-britsch.com/shop/catalog/navigationPath/139). These
collets have these characteristics:

* Body diameter 25mm
* Length 89mm
* Collet taper 32 degrees
* Round bore till 22mm
* Max pass-through bore 17mm
* Thread M23x1

However, in [this
post](https://forum.zerspanungsbude.net/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=43517&start=290#p923430),
Iron-rage notes that the thread profile is not metric but a 55 degrees
one, maybe Whitworth. The thread, then, do not corresponds to the 363E
type. The conclusion is that **s25** is a non-standard type of collets
with thread Z23x1.

It is known that 363E collets feel a bit tight when threading into
Leinen drawbar. This should be the reason.
