In the way of renovate the Schaublin 13, it is time to manage the lamp
support and its connection. Lamp is attached to the side of the
machine and, in the interior, a small junction box would be
desirable. I tailored a made-to-size box of steel sheet.

I began by accurately marking a medium thickness steel sheet and
cutting it to size using a simple hand saw. Corners have been drilled
previously to make easier the bending process.

After that, the  sheet is bent on the big blacksmith vice with the
help of a hammer. The last bendins step needs some additional supports
of a reduced size as can be seen on the pictures below.

Next step is to weld the new edges that form the box.

Finally, the box is drilled and finished by filing smoothly the weld
seams. Just some coating and the box is ready,

It will be screwed in the machine interior using the same through
drills that are used to screw on the lamp support. The last pictures
show the result. With this, the connection of the wiring pipe is much
more nice and robust.
