Next step in the SV13 overhauling path has been to end the horizontal
spindle head and mount it into its ways definitively. Some works
remain to be done: finish the fitting of the slideways, clean and
relube the feed screw assembly, do the cosmetic work and finally
inspect and relube if needed the spindle bearings.

# Precisely fit the slideways

In a [previous post]({{< ref "schaublin13-refurbish-5" >}} "previous
post") I explained the firsts steps to refurbish the horizontal spindle
head of the milling machine. Its slideways where surely the most
weared part of the machine and thus they needed a careful
attention. If they where difficult to repair by scraping, the machine
refurbish plan would have been reconsidered. Fortunately, as shown in
the post, geometry have been improved and the head was then in an
acceptable condition. Now it is time to go one step ahead and finish
the slideways precisely.

To dimish the rocking motion of the head I decide to apply the same
scraping technique I observed on the flat bearing part: the central
part was slightly depressed in such a way that contact occurs only on
the front and back extremes of the steady slidingway member. Thus I
considered the dovetail flat in thirdhs ans scraped slighly deeper the
central third. This is applied to the gib and its symmetrical
face. With this technique the rocking motion was diminished as
needed. At the same time, the aligments where constantly checked to
guarantee that othogonality with the table is achieved.

The next picture shows the gib contact during one iteration of the
scraping procedure (the contact is not yet perfect). It's clear that
the center is slightly depressed.

Following, there are two pictures of the orthogonality measuring
technique. In this case, a master square against the table slots sets
the reference.

Finally a very good fitting and geometry is achieved: no more than 2µm
of deviation can be measured as shown in the next video:

# The feed screw

The feed screw of the horizontal head is rather complex: it is drived
from a top handle or, alternatively, from a side handle. This means
that there is some (precise) gearing to adapt the driving handle
direction. I dimantled, cleaned and relubed all the bearings and gears
belonguin to this set. Bearings where cleaned first in gasoline and
then dived into a mix of gasoline and Kluber Isoflex LDS 18 special
grease as told by Schaublin manual. After waiting some hours for
gasoline to evaporate, the bearing gets perfectly lubed. Gears where
greased with Kluber Altemp Q NB 50, a kind of very adherent paste
grease as said too in the maintenance instructions.

Following, there are some pictures of this assembly. First the
subassembly that supports the top handle. It ends with a spiral miter
gear that drives the feed screw. In the middle of the shaft, a small
screw gear is drived by (or drives) the side handle shaft.

What follows is the horizontal shaft that is rotated by the side
handle. It protrudes on each side of the horizontal head.

All the above gears are used to rotate the feed screw. This screw
assembly is shown in the next picture:

From this, it is interesting to observe this ring:

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="anell-ajustatge.jpg" >}}

By turning the slotted screw, the length of this separator ring
increases or decreases. This allows to slightly move the feed screw
bevel gear to adjust the contact with its mating. The set screw of
this ring is turned from the bottom side of the head slideway. The
adjusting procedure should be done with all the gearing assembled. A
special key should be made to ajust the ring:

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="clau-1.jpg" >}}
{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="clau-2.jpg" >}}

With this mechanism, the play of the gears can be adjusted nicely.

## How is the feed screw lubed?

It remains an interesting point to understand. The SV13 manual do not
tells about the head feed screw lube. The rest of the machie feed
screws are lubed by the pump circuit. This is not the case for this
screw. If manual lube where needed, I guess the manual would say
it. How can oil end on this screw?


# Cosmetic works

As usual, the horizontal head is beautyfied by smoothing its surface
and later on spraying the lacker. Next picture shows the head just
after sprying the color coat.

# Spindle bearings maintenance

Last step has been to do the spindle bearings maintenance. I hesitate
on how to proceed. The spindle was running realy smooth and with a
rnout of 2µm. In one hand, the good sense said that better not
unassemble it. On the other, take care of it would assure it is well
lubed form many time. Finally opted by a intermediate path. I
partially extracted the spindle from the head until bearings were
visible. Following the manual procedure it was a simple matter. From
the sight inspection, I guessed that bearings were relubed a long time
ago or maybe never. I prepared a mix of grease and gasoline, injected
the mix on the bearings and waited the gasoline to evaporate. Surely
not the best but I'm pretty sure a bearings received enough grease for
a long time.

I wander if it would have been better to practice a full dissassemble
and a new relube. However, this is easy to do in the future if needed.

After assembling again the spindle, the bearings should be
preloaded. The manual suggests a 10µm preloading and tells how to
achieve by screwing a given angle the adjusting nut of the spindle.  I
followed this procedure. First, the nut was screwed until no lateral
play can be measured. I assumed this is the «0 preload point». After
that, the screw is turned by a small controlled fraction as told by
the manual. This resulted on a no play spindle and an internal runout
of less than 2µm. The next video shows the test:
