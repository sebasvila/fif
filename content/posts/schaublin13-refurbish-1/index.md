Long time ago I bought a Schaublin 13 milling machine to Peter at
[Veltman Machines](http://veltmanmachines.nl). This was to replace my
[Cincinatti
Chomienne FP30]({{< relref cincinatti-chomienne-fp >}}). The
machine remained stored for many months and finally it arrived the
time to face its refurbishing.

In this post I face the service of the motors and rework the
electrical conducts.

This Schaublin 13 has a BL number of 259204 and, according to [BL to
date
correspondence](http://anglo-swiss-tools.co.uk/general-information-on-historic-schaublin-machines/),
should be made about the 1975. It is the next to last model build of
thius classic milling machine. It can be recognized easily by its
centralized lubrication system that shares the oil tank with the
gearbox.

# Moving the machine to a working place

The first job done on it was to move it over a set of wood risers that
facilitate to remove the motors. The machine is really heavy amounting
about 800 Kg. It was moved on a pallet truck and elevated by using
chain hoist. The next picture shows it.

The machine was leveled, let it stabilize on the wood risers and
leveled again. Then, I took apart the vertical milling head. It came
with the unusual head 13-10.400, with a quill that can be displaced 60
mm. This head is heavy and weights around 37 Kg, not easy to move at
hand. Following, there are a couple of pictures of the head:

This is a general view of the machine without the head and with the
horizontal milling arbor in place:

# Dismantle the base elements

Now, the cleaning should begin. The electrical motors (power motor and
fast displacement motor) where located in the bottom of the machine
body. You should get the space by an specific window in the back of
the machine base.

The base interior is full of dirt as usual. After removing electrical
conducts and unscrewing the motor from the plate I got it out without
problems. The main motor is an IEC 90L of 1,5 Kw. It was absolutely
covered by dirt and milling chips as it can be seen in next picture:

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="main-motor.jpg" >}}

Now, the fast displacement motos should be dismantled. This is a small
motor vertically screwed to the base.

Although not easy to reach the screws, finally I managed to get it
out. Last, I dismantled also the fast displacements pedal and its
electrical parts.

I discovered that the plastic cover of the electrical conducts were
absolutely fragile after many hours soaked in oil spills. Thus, it
will be required to replace all of the conducts.

# Clean the motors, suports and parts

I begin by cleaning the fast forward limit switch. It was full of a
greasy grime that I stripped down using [CRC Lectra
Clean](https://www.crcindustries.com/products/lectra-clean-174-heavy-duty-electrical-parts-degreaser-19-wt-oz.html). The
liquid, a mix of hydrocarbons, is effective but solves the exterior
paint. Probably exterior paint was weakened by years of oil
contact. This is a picture of the dismantled switch:

Cleaning the motors was not a so simple task. In the one hand,
choosing a water based cleaning fluid is not recommended because it
can induce internal humidity; in the other, using a solvent based
product can remove the wiring varnish. It seems that specific products
like Lectra Clean can be appropiate, but previous experience with the
switch and its paint make me undecided. After reading about others
experience, I gave an opportunity to Lectra Clean and with utmost care
I cleaned the motors. The aestethical result was satisfactory. I put
the motors at the sun to be fully dried. A very small oily residue
accumulated on the bottom. I wish that wiring isolation had not being
altered. Dismantling the motors allowed me to inspect the bearings,
clean and regrease them. Below there is a picture of the main motor
fully disassembled after being cleaned and dryed.

The electrical conducts should also be replaced. I choosed [Adaptaflex
SP
conduct](https://new.abb.com/low-voltage/products/conduit-fittings/adaptaflex/flexible-metallic-conduit-systems/metallic-conduits/type-sp)
as the replacement. Unfortunately the fittings where PG standard: that
means that the leftovers will not be easy to use. However, the new
conducts and its fittings were really appealing as you can see in the
following pictures:

{{< image classes="fig-100 center clear" src="tubs2.jpg" >}}

The fast forward pedal was also cleaned and its parts derusted. Here
you can see the subset of pedal parts including its switch:
