Some days ago Sam Kowalski, a happy owner of a Boley-Leinen lathe
asked me for the dimensions of the collet's drawbar. He is posting
some nice pictures of his lathe restoration in the [Old Wood Working
Machines
forum](http://www.owwm.org/viewtopic.php?f=77&t=140944&p=946397#p946397).
Sam, here you have a handmade sketch of the drawbar ;-). Don't
hesitate to ask for more details if needed.

{{< alert warning >}} 
Beware that last informations about Boley Leinen collets for LZ4xx
lathes tell that the threading is not M23x1 but a specific thread, say
Z23x1, the profile of which is 55ยบ instead of 60ยบ of metric standard.

Take a look at [this post about my collets set]({{< ref
found-set-of-collets-in-ebay >}}).
