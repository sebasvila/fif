Nothing annoys more to me that a machine loosing oil and spilling it
on the floor. Despite this, many machines are designed with not too
much attention to this detail and lost oil mechanisms are usual. The
Schaublin 13 has also some mechanisms that loose oil by design and
some of them spill the oil on the floor.. ugly design I would say.

The variator displacement shaft is on of those assemblies. It
displaces the variator pulley up and down while maintaining the
aligment. The vertical shaft moves constrained by a couple of plain
bearings that should be lubricated. Oil arrives to the shaft following
a descending way: it flows from the variator handle bearing to the
mitter gear, from this to a small bassin on top that oils the axial
bearing, the feed screw and the vertical support shaft. After this
path.. oil drips over the motor :frowning_face:

I decided to put an oil pan just in the bottom of the shaft. I made it
by turning an aluminium part and adding four magnets to attach it to
the shaft. The magnets also maintain a space between the shaft and the
collector to allow the oil to flow from the interior of the shaft. The
aluminium part ends with a plastic lid recycled from some kitchen can
(not the fancier, I would admit).

It is easy to pull out to empty the lid when full and avoid oil
spilling over the motor. I wish it to be an improvement.
