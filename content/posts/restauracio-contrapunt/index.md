Let's start by restoring the tailstock, which seems to be in pretty
good condition. Tailstock is unusual since it is designed in such a
way that the barrel remains fully supported despite its position. It's
a typical construction of some precision machines. The tailstock is
fixed to the bed using a lever that acts on a cam lock. The spindle
is locked by  classic crescents. The fit of the barrel is very
good, especially in the first part of the displacement.  After fully
disassembling it:

Once disassembled, some small anomalies are observed. There is some
wear in the area where the adjusting nuts they rub on their
support. This is the point where pressure is applied when, for
example, it is pressed against the part being machined. At the moment
we will write this detail on the "pending" list and will address it
further.

We proceed to carefully clean the metal parts. We followed the next
technique so as not to damage any of the original textures such as
roughness of the original machining of the parts:

1. Degreased with equal parts diesel+gasoline mixture.
2. Cleaning the oxidized surfaces with vinegar (carefully) and the
   help of rags and occasionally very fine steel wool.
3. Application of white oil (type WD40) to protect the surfaces.
4. In the parts that require a better finish, I use polishing paste
   applied with a cotton disc. First, an application of fine roughing
   polishing paste and, after that, using a different disc, finishing
   paste.

Then we go on with the coating. We removed the old paint with coarse
sandpaper. We applyed a quality synthetics primer that supports the
finish layer. We applyed 2K filler and we smoothed it. At the end we
conscientiously sanded the surface to a good finish. Finally, we
applyed two-component polyurethane enamel, which is remarkably
resistant and has given us very good results in other restorations.

The supplier of paint products was Torrents Autocolor. The paint hue
chosen is [RAL 7031](http://ralcolor.net/ral-7031-blue-grey.php),
after checking the original color. The paint must be tinted exprofeso
with a tintometric machine. After applying the finishing layer with a
brush and assemble the tailstock again:
