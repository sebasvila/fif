An old Waldmann WD 306 luminaire is added to the Boley Leinen
lathe. The luminaire is nowadays old but it is still a very good
design. Can be found at a reasonable price and, after servicing it,
make a very good value for money.

The Boley Leinen lathe acquired a new attachment: an old but serious
Waldmann WD306 machine luminaire. This kind of luminaire is designed
to be used in machines: it is mechanically robust and protected
against oil spills. It contains a set of three small fluorescent tubes
that give a nice amount of white light. The ballast is mounted inside
the arm in a very compact way.

I got the luminaire from an eBay bid. Some part have been replaced
that where worn by the use. It was a surprise to discover that
[Waldmann](https://www.waldmann.com/home.764.en.html) served the spare
parts with no problems although we are facing a really old
model. Great!

To be mounted in the lathe, a made-to-size support was needed. I made
it by using some scrap steel parts. It was fitter to some predrilled
holes on the back of the lathe. Unfortunately. I made no pictures of
this.

The next picture shows the luminaire in the lathe:
