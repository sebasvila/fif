The work on the UNIZ 14" power hacksaw goes on! Almost all the elements
are now cleaned, adjusted ans painted again. Most of the parts are
reassembled again and the saw begins to show its best.

The saw comes without its singular switch. In some weeks we will begin
the work with the electrical wiring. The main target will be to
overhaul its electrical system using a more conventional micro-switch
and relay scheme.

I left here some pictures of the today's state:
