After having read many times about the Boley Leinen LZ4SB in
[lathes.uk](http://www.lathes.co.uk/leinen/) and being sure that It
would be impossible to get one of them here in Catalunya, unexpectly I
found one of them in the Hospitalet del Llobregat used machine dealer
[Ferrimaq](http://www.ferrimaq.com/Maquinaria-de-ocasion.html). That
was incredible!

After closing the deal, the machine arrived at home's garage. A
wonderful machine to overhaul!

Following there are some pictures of the lathe just arrived to my
garage. The lathe come with some tools: a three jaws chuck, some live
and dead centers, a drill chuck and, most notably, a fast change
toolholder and a follower and a steady rest.
