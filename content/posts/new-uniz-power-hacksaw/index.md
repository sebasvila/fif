This Feb 21 we have been in [Juncosa (Les
Garrigues)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juncosa) to buy an old Uniz
power hacksaw. This is the smaller of several Uniz saws. It is labeled
as 14in and has a 160mm cutting capacity on round bills. Built in the
Basque country around the 60's, the company ceased time ago. The saw
is really sturdy with a weight of more than 300 kg. It was kindly
transported by my brother [Jordi](http://www.argotphoto.com/).

I left here a couple of pictures of the machine just arrived:
