An important task during the Leinen lathe refurbishing is to recover
it's original aesthetics. This a time consuming process if you want a
quality result. These are the main tasks:

* Clean and remove rust of surfaces
* Polish the surfaces
* Prepare the surfaces to be painted
* Paint

# Working with the shiny surfaces

The procedure applied to recover the shiny surfaces is as follows:

1. Degrease and clean it. Diverse solvents can be used depending on
   the case. Mostly use diesel oil, petrol, or current kitchen
   degreasers.
2. If needed, remove the rust. This can be done by mechanical methods
   using a inox rotary brush. In the case the part is highly polished,
   you can use vinegar. Soak a rag in vinegar and cover the surface
   with it. Rub the part with it until rust removed.
3. Polish the part using polishing paste and a polishing disk (of
   cotton of fiber depending on needs). Finish always with pink
   polishing paste to a mirror finish. [Pferd
   pastes](https://us.pferd.com/en/polishing-paste) can be used.

The procedure is slow but really good results are achieved. Note the

and then, some of the parts of the apron after being recovered:

# Paint works

The procedure to overhaul the painted parts follows the next steps:

1. Clean and degrease the parts as explained in the previous section.
2. Protect holes, plates, shiny parts and all kind of stuff which
   should be maintained unpainted. Cover them using good quality
   masking tape.
3. Evaluate the overall state of the putty layers. If it is
   impregnated by oil or exhibits bad adherence or there are cracks in
   the surface, it is better to remove the putty until steel is
   uncovered. Apply two components carbody putty again to smooth the
   parts. Smooth the putty with decreasing grain sandpaper.
4. Paint a coating layer with filler.
5. To achieve a really smooth finish the filler using wet sandpaper
   of very fine grain.
6. Finally apply tow coats of two components polyurethane enamel. Use
   a very fine foam roller: it results in a nice finish without the
   problems of an air gun.

The result are parts as follow:
