The Studer FH 450 flat grinding machine was manufactured between 1946
and 1967, according to David Samways' website
(https://anglo-swiss-tools.co.uk/studer-grinding-machines). Accordint
to private mail, Studer provided service for this machine until 1990.

Due to its rarity, information about this model is scarce in common
machining forums. To my knowledge, only six or seven users have ever
posted about it.

I own one of these machines, which is currently awaiting
refurbishment. In the meantime, I am collecting information and
disassembling parts to better assess its actual condition.

I have gathered several manuals and brochures, but they are
essentially the same as those published on David's website. In what
follows, I will name it as 'the manual'.

Through this process, I have noticed multiple variations in different
FH 450 machines, even just by examining available photographs. At this
point, I am convinced these differences stem from evolutionary design
changes along time. Additionally, I have confirmed that the spindle in
my machine differs from the one illustrated in the manual I possess.

My hypothesis is that two versions of the machine were made and the
manual corresponds mostly with the newer one.

In the following sections, I outline the variations I have observed,
listed in no particular order. I have excluded differences that are
clearly due to factory configuration choices at the time of purchase.

# Variations of Studer FH 450 #

## Spindle lubrication system ##

Some machines have an internal pump that circulates oil to the front
plain bearing. This roughly corresponds to the spindle diagram in the
manual. Others, including mine, use an external drip-feed oiler. The
difference is easily recognizable from the outside.

Furthermore, lubrication methods for other bearings vary. Some
machines feature grease nipples or wick-feed oilers. For instance, in
my machine, what I believe to be the third spindle bearing is
lubricated by a wick oiler located on top of the spindle head.

## Wheel guard ##

Certain machines are equipped with a hinged wheel guard that includes
a built-in mount for a comparator. Other machines use a wheel guard
secured by four thumb nuts. In this latter case, a rotating ring at
the center of the guard holds the comparator support, allowing it to
be lifted away when not in use. The manual includes pictures of both
arrangements but does not explicitly mention this difference.

## Wheel dresser unit ##

Most machines have a sliding dressing unit mounted on top of the wheel
cover. I have identified two distinct versions. The first has a
pronounced rounded shape. The second version features a distinctly
angular design. My machine is equipped with the latter, more
squared-off version.

## Splash guards ##

Splash guards also vary between machines. Some are cast aluminum,
while others are made from sheet metal.

## Fine vertical nonius markings ##

In some machines, the fine vertical knob nonius is is marked with 100
divisions, each corresponding to a 0.001 mm vertical displacement. 
Manual tells that the vertical feedscrew has a thread pitch of 4mm and
it is moved by a 40:1 worm gear. This would be one machine version.

In other machines, like mine, the knob is marked with 250 marks, each
corresponding to a displacement of 0,001 mm also. The thread pitch is
of 7,5mm, thus the worm gear should have a 30:1 ratio. This would be
the another machine version.

## Traverse slideways ##

Traverse slideways differ between machines. Some use a flat-flat
design with an adjustable gib, while others feature the more
traditional flat-vee guideway system. My machine has the flat-flat
configuration.

## My hypothesis about versions ##

I suspect that there are two primary versions of the Studer FH 450: an
earlier version (OLD) and a later version (NEW). Below is a summary of
the differences I have observed:

| Part                | OLD           | NEW             |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Spindle lubrication | Drip oiler    | Internal pump   |
| Wheel guard         | Finger nuts   | Hinged          |
| Wheel dresser       | Angular shape | Rounded shape   |
| Splash guards       | Sheet metal   | Cast aluminum   |
| Vertical nonius     | 250 marks     | 100 marks       |
| Traverse slideways  | Flat-flat     | Flat-vee        |

This classification is based on observed differences and may require
further verification. Mine belongs to OLD version type.
