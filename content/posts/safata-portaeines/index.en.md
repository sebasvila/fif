The factory pictures of the lathe show a tool tray and stand for the
blueprints. We made a tray identical to the original. The work of
steel sheet, for which we have no material or tools, was made by
[Lázaro Metalpress](http://www.lazarometalpres.com/). The result, once
painted is this:

The tray was covered by a neoprene sheet of [Plàstics
Pujol](http://www.tiendadeplasticos.es/).
