During the COVID'19 lockdown I spent part of my time disassembling the
drilling press. In this post I will show the cosmetic works. The
machine arrived with a nasty layer of lack over the original one. I
decided to spend time recovering its original aspect. This required to
strip off all the paint in bad condition and tp prepare the surface to
be lackered again. In some parts, like the pulleys cover, I go until
the bare metal. In others, I decided to preserve the original putty
layers. If gone to metal, I first applied a layer of etching
primer. In both cases, I followed with a filler layer and finally
lackered with synthetic enamel RAL 6011, which was the original tone.

Not inusual, I had some problems with the filler layer. It is prone to
crack when it dries. Probably due to the high tensions that appear
when autoleveling. I guess that the support is not good enought. It's
really annoying. After repeating the cycle of sanding and spraying
filler several times, most of the problems disapperared (but not all
of them).

Below you will find some pictures of the proces.
