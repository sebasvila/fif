Preface

# Works that can be done #

# Know the boring head #

These are the main parts of the boring head (see the previous figure).

1. The shank.
2. The slide, that moves across the diameter of the head and has a
   number of holes to attach the tools.
3. The locking screw. It locks the slide to avoid traveling.
4. The travel ring. It displaces the ring and it is marked in
   0,05 mm steps.
5. The vernier scale. This ring can be moved to set the "O" of the
   displacement ring. A set screw frees it to rotate. Additionally, it
   allows to read displacements of 0,005 mm by using the vernier
   marks.
6. The holding ring. This ring has a hole were the steady bar can be
   used to avoid it rotating. The part that holds the bar works as a
   switch that runs back the slide.
7. The P-A disk. This is used to select the head function: A for
   boring and P for facing counterbores. Can be switched easily by
   hand if the holding device is the right position. You will discover
   the position by trying.
8. The return stop. It is used to stop the slide during the return
   travel.
9. The forward stop. It is used to limit the forward travel of the
   slide and, thus, it sets the max cutting diameter when facing.
10. The control pin. It makes easier to check if the forward travel
   has traveled to the limit set up by the forward stop.
   
The slide has three vertical holes of 10mm and an horizontal one. They
are used to attach the tooling. Slide runs to the left (try it by
moving the travel ring by increasing the marked numbers).

## Dimensions and working limits

- Shank turns clockwise
- Facing and boring from 2mm to 180mm
- Max slide travel 30mm
- Radial slide feed per revolution 0,05mm
- Slide fast backwards per revolution 2,5mm
- Slide min feed 0,05mm (0,005mm reading on the vernier)
- Tools shank diameter 10mm

# Boring holes

Boring work is done with the P-A disk in position A. Simply attach the
right tool (depending if it is a through bore or not) and adjust the
slide to "0" by moving the slide till the tool is on the hole
wall. Move the vernier ring to the zero position to have a
reference. Just move the travel ring in the increasing way by the
cutting depth you need and bore it. Remember to lock the slide using
the locking screw before begin ti cut. This adds rigidity and avoids
premature wear. Be aware of managing the backlash in a proper
way. Repeat until the desired diameter is achieved.

Notice that the tool should be attached to a right hole. The hint is
to remember that the slide travels at most about 30mm.

Additionally, you can set the vernier ring in such a way that "0"
corresponds to the final diameter and work by cutting until the travel
ring arrives to "0". The end stop can also be useful if you are boring
a batch of parts that can be attached in the same precise
position. Just bore the first part to size and, when in the final
position, move the end stop.

# Facing or counterboring

For this work the slide moves automatically. At the same time the head
turns, the slide travels continuously. This allows to cut a flat face
around a hole (counterboring).

Because of the automatic traveling is much better to work using the
stops. The procedure is the following:

1. Attach the right tool.
2. Free the locking screw of the slide.
3. Move the slide until it is on the hole wall. 
4. Set the forward stop using the scale and vernier. What you read
   there is the maximum radius travel of the slide. Then, the diameter
   of the counterbore will be twice what is read in the scale.
5. Move the slide back a bit just to free the tool. Set the back
   stop. This will stop the slide when doing the fast back travel.
6. Move down the head the cutting depth amount.
6. Now things are ready to begin cutting.
8. Start the head rotation
9. Stop the retaining ring with the hand. As it turns free, it is not
   an issue.
7. Insert the stick to retain the holding ring. You will not appreciate
   too much presure due to head gearing.
8. Move the A-P disk to P position. You should find the right position
   for the stick holder.
9. The slide begins to travel slowly in the sense of increasing travel
   ring numbers. Soon it will begin cuttind the face.
10. When it reaches the forward stop, a pressure clutch will stop the
    slide travel. You should turn the A-P disk to the A position
    again. This stops the automatic traveling. You can do this without
    stopping the head. Is important to move the disk to A position
    soon to avoid damaging the clutch.
11. It's time to move the head to the initial position by using the
    fast back travel. Just move the hold stick to the back. The
    holding part rotates slightly and the back travel activated.
12. The slide goes back very fast untill de back stop is reached. A
    natural movement of the stick stops the back travel.
13. Without stoping the head, you can give more cutting depth and
    begin the cycle again until done.
	
The same procedure can be used to deep counterbore, to make a
hole bottom flat or to cut a recess inside the hole.

Sometimes, it's difficult to appreciate if a cut arrived to the
end. Specially, when the cut is done deep in the hole. The head
provides a clever jig for testing whether the slide arrived at the
stop or, by some reason, the friction clutch was stopped it before. 
Push the small control pin to the left. When the slide approaches the
end of travel the pin will be pushed by the stop. After sliding back
the tool, you can check if the slide traveled to end.
