The Schaublin 13 lubrication pump deserves a service now that there is
no oil in circuit and it is easy to disassemble.

Given its simple design, to service it you should just replace three
or-rings. Two of them are the seals of the pumb body, that avoid oil
leaking from the tank. The most interesting to replace, however, is
the o-ring of the piston. To replace it you should first free the
piston by pushing a pin out. This can be done by aligning a specific
hole on the piston: this allows to reach the pin with a pin punch
drive. The following pictures show this process. The right sizes of
the three o-rings are tabulated in the [blog entry about o-rings]({{<
ref "/posts/schaublin13-orings" >}}).

The next picture shows the hole used to push the piston retaining pin.

After aligning the piston pass through hole, you can push the
retaining pin.

This is an exploded viwe of the pump piston and one of two ball valves
inside.
