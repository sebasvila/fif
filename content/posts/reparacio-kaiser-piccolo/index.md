The Kaiser Piccolo is exquisitely made small boring head with boring
and automatic facing functions. I got a ISO30 one in a very nice
condition together with a bunch of tooling. When tested it performed
very fine but I couldn't switch easily between facing and boring
(marked as P and A in the head, maybe for the french «planage» and
«alésage»). It needs to be serviced to cope with this jam.

## The Kaiser Piccolo boring head

The Kaiser boring head is a middle size boring head with a facing and
boring range from 2mm to 180mm. The slide travel is about 30mm
maximum. It has three functions:

- boring, with a minimum diameter adjusting step of 0,005 mm
- facing, where the slide has an automatic feed of 0,05 mm per
  revolution
- fast slide return, where the slide return automatically at 2,5mm per
  revolution
  
The head has a friction clutch that limits the slide and allows the
slide displacement be limited by stops.

I know of two versions of the head. The old version could be easily
recognized by its small rotary switch between boring and facing
functions. I own a new version one with an STP shank. This is a Kaiser
specific shank used as an interface to other standard shanks. In this
case it mounts an ISO 30 shank.
