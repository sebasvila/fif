# An example post

Because of reasons, I needed to drill some shafts with some weird
diameters. I didn't have the required bushes. Then, I decided to make
some of them. This post shows how I did.

These are the most salient characteristics of this project:

  * Material. I choosed O2 steel. Easy to mechanize and harden. Hard
    enough after thermical treament.

  * Dimensioning. I got the main dimensioning from other bushes in the
    set and adapted them to the hole dimension.

  * Bushes where hard-turned to size after being hardened to cope with
    dimension changes induced by heat treatment.
