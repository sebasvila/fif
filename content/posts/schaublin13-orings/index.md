While overhauling the Schaublin 13, some o-rings are to be
replaced. The original plans show a cryptic reference for the
parts. We found how they relate to o-ring sizes.

<!--more-->

The Schaublin manual shows o-ring referencies of type PRP-ddd where
ddd stands for a 3 digits number. We realized that this corresponds to
the 3 digits o-ring numbered series of standard SAE AS568. This allows
us to check again the replaced o-rings for its right dimensions.

In the following table, you will find a summary of o-rings we replaced
during the Schaublin 13 (1974 model) overhauling.
