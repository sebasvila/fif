Last days, I discovered that old grinding belts are prone to break by
the scarf joint. This is an annoying but solvable issue.

# Grinding belts have an expiration date

Yes. Grinding belts have an expiration date because the glue used in
the scarf joint do not lasts forever. This was surprising for me! I
discovered the hard way. Some days ago, I needed to sand some boards
but I couln't achieve it: all the (new) grinding belts I tested
were splitted cleanly by the scarf after one or two seconds of using
it on the grinder.

Annoyed by this, I begun a search on the net that ended with that
result: grinding belts have a finite shelf life. I have a set of them
unglued and a bunch that will unglue for sure: can them be glued
again?

# Searching a glue

Which kind of glue can we use to glue again the belts? It should
support an important strength and, when working hard, also a
significant temperature. Indeed, it cannot be rigid once cured: the
belt turns through a short radius roller and the join must be
flexible enough.

After some test with other glues, I discovered that there are flexible
cyanocrylate glue ---they contain gum dust mixed. This was the glue
that offered to me the best results. I choosed exactly [Loxeal
74](https://www.loxeal.be/fr/produit/74/) and a made to size press
make easy the glueing. The result was outstanding:
