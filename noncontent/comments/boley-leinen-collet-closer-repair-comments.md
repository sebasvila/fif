Hi Chris,  
  
I haven't a precise method, I'm sorry. I suggest you to follow the advertisements of these machines. Sometimes they are announced by giving the serial number and the year of manufacture. Maybe you can guess the age by comparison.  
Dou you have any pictures and the serial number in some place I can look at?

I am hoping you could give me some advice.  
  
There are parts that I am missing and hope that you could provide me with the specifications so i can rebuild them or replace them,  
  
The first is of the change gears and i am missing the screw and some kind of washer. Could you send me a photo with dimensions?  
  
The belt cover is missing the screws and perhaps a block support?  
  
I am inexperienced in this area and would be extremely grateful if you can help.  
  
I have seen the images on your blog so many times i really admire the work you do.  
  
Thanks for your consideration and time. I have tried to add pictures but i cannot for some reason. Please pm me at marondesigns@gmail.com and I can send them too you.  
  
  
Thanks so much.  
  
Kind Regards,  
Chris.

Hi sBs,  
  
let me just say, big thumbs up on the blog and the restoration of your lathe, what a beautiful result. One thing i find strange is that with the collet closer installed, the hatch to get access to the change gears is blocked. My lathe shows some damage on the hatch because of this. I wonder if this is poor design (hard to imagine) or if it was always intended like that. Kind regards from Belgium and keep up the good work, Jonas

Hi Jonas,  
  
You are right -I checked it after your comment-: with the collet closer installed you cannot access the change gears. Think of the collet closer as mainly devoted to batch working. In these situations reconfiguring change gears isn't very usual. Of course, it would be better if no interaction existed between both elements. I'm also thinking that model MLZ would made this design flaw almost irrelevant... just some thoughts about to share with you ;-)
