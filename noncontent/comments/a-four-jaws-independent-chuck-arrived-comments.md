Nice chuck. I am looking for a four jaw for my Leinen also. What is the size and weight of this chuck? Do you know what is the recommended maximum diameter is?  
On another note: I see from the last picture that you have a different lead screw cover than I have. Have you changed it? My problem is that when using collets, I can not get up close to the spindle nose (collet) with the tool. The lead screw cover is compressed all the way, but blocks the carriage from moving closer to the spindle.  
I appreciate some information on these matters. Thank you.  
  
Btw. You are the only other MLZ 4 owner I have found. These machines must be really rare :-)  
  
Cheers

Hello Arnljot,  
  
the chuck is a Rohm UGE-UGU 200mm KK4 (https://www.roehm.biz/fileadmin/content/pdf/products/en/03\_Lathe%20chucks\_Independent%20chucks\_en\_web.pdf). It weighs roughly 10kg. The diameter is ok for the lathe dimensions. However, I would prefer a lighter chuck like the older ones (for instance http://lumberjocks.com/topics/66285). In my opinion, it's more aproppiate for the Leinen. Unfortunately, I found none of them.  
  
I really replaced the leadscrew cover (see http://fusta-i-ferro.blogspot.com.es/2013/09/the-boley-leinen-lz4-is-ready.html). The new bellow was tailored by a provider according to my dimensions to replace the old one. To move the carriage next to the spindle I should compress the bellow more than it is desirable. However, I can do it. In fact, the original bellow was thinner and, when compressed, wasted slightly less space. I can try to recover the dimensions of the bellow if you need them.  
  
I guess that there are many Leinen lathes all around but not many information in the net... anyway they are nice machines.  
  
See you!
