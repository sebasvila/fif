Hi, this is an amazing restoration job, and the finished product is stunning. I recently purchased a similar leinen lathe, I believe it is a model L3. Unfortunately, mine came without the collet draw bar. I was hoping that you could post the dimensions of your draw bar so that I could manufacture one for my lathe. I know the threading is M23x1, and that our lathes use the same collets (mine actually came with a collet marked 'LZ43 Feinmechanik.').  
  
Thanks

Hi Sam, I will try to post the drawbar dimensions next weekend. Where are you writing from? Do you have any pictures of you lathe posted somewhere?
